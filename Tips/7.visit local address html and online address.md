if you want visit local html file,you can just open it with Browsers, but if you want connect with online server,you have to by http://127.0.0.1:[port number]/[file.name].

So you have to first add html.file in express.(Detail see Tips[3])and start the local server($ node [filename].js).

if the port number can't be use, you can
$ lsof -i :[port number]
$ kill [PID number]
